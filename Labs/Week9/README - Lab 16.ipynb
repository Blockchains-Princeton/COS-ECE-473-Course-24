Our aim will be to borrow USDC tokens using NFTs as collateral. This is a similar concept to Aave, a platform we have previously seen, but instead with NFTs that have a pre-determined LTV (Locked Total Value) that is calculated by the platform.\n","\n","### To collaterize your position:\n","\n","- We first need some NFTs in our wallet that can be used as collateral. Use the Paribus faucet to claim tokens. To do so, go to https://faucet.paribus.io/ and connect your wallet. Paribus' testnet supports the Sepolia network. Then `Claim tokens`.\n","\n","- On their lending testnet https://lending.testnet.paribus.io/, you will be presented with your dashboard where your deposit and borrow balances, borrow limit, net APY and total interest accrued values are displayed.\n","\n","- Enter the NFTs section and deposit a supported NFT (one received from the faucet) by approving the token transfer and depositing (two transactions). (Note: The testnet uses an LTV of 40% for these test NFTs. In the mainnet platform, these LTVs would be determined by various market conditions rather than a fixed LTV for all assets.)\n","\n","- Both your deposit balance and borrow limit will now have increased.\n","\n","### To borrow USDC tokens:\n","\n","- Go to the Markets section and select USDC from the available assets.\n","- In the currently borrowing pane, click `Borrow`.\n","- You can borrow any amount under your borrow limit. Select the 80% limit option (this is analogous to Aave V3's allowance of 80% of the ETH collateral value).\n","- Click `Borrow` and send the transaction.\n","- If you add the USDC contract address to your metamask wallet token list, you should see an increase in your USDC balance after borrowing.\n","\n","Note: At this point, if you were to attempt to withdraw an NFT you have deposited as collateral that would put your borrow limit below your currently borrowed assets, the platform will disallow this transaction (the transaction fails due to the protocol's implementation), and hence you will not be able to retrieve your NFT back until you repay the loan.\n","\n","### To repay the loan by paying back USDC tokens and retrieve your deposited NFT:\n","\n","- Within the USDC asset page, click `Repay`.\n","- Select `Max` and repay the loan by clicking `Pay Back Full`. Approve the spending cap and submit the repay trasnsaction.\n","- The platform now allows you to withdraw your NFT that you previously deposited within the NFT section.\n","\n","Note: Typically, in similar NFT lending platforms, if the loan is not repaid, the NFT is unlocked and the platform becomes the owner of the NFT. The liquidation section of Paribus allows you to purchase NFTs from accounts that are being liquidated at discounted prices.\n"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.8"},"colab":{"provenance":[{"file_id":"1kbBoci51nrsq5ARrXrSeLNauKWhu_dYw","timestamp":1711306021874}]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
