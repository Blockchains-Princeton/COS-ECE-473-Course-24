    "# Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interacting with various types of on-chain exchanges as a trader\n",
    "\n",
    "# Prerequisites \n",
    "- Metamask extension should be installed on the browser, if not, install Metamask from [here](https://metamask.io/) and fund it using the sepolia faucet [here](https://sepoliafaucet.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Trading on decentralized exchange applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Decentralized exchanges can be categorized into two broad categories:\n",
    "- Dapps mimicking traditional centralized exchanges and implementing an order book\n",
    "- Dapps running DeFi native exchange formats such as AMMs\n",
    "In this lab, we will interact with one exchange of each of the above types through their web app.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trade on an order book exchange\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Order book exchange enables trading by running sequential trades on an order book. The order book contains *bids* from agents who want to buy an asset, and *asks* from agents who want to sell the asset. A trade occurs when a bid matches an ask. One can perform two primary types of orders on such an exchange. \n",
    "- A *market order* is an order that executes the trade at the best available bid or asks.\n",
    "- A *limit order* that sets a bid or ask on an order book that is executed at a price within limits set by the order.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will interact with dYdX V4, an order book DEX implemented on the dYdX Chain testnet. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Open [dYdX V4 testnet app](https://v4.testnet.dydx.exchange/#/trade/ETH-USD)\n",
    "- Click on the top-right corner to connect your metamask wallet \n",
    "- After the connection, click *Deposit funds* (or *deposit*)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now be performing a market order. Please follow the steps below: \n",
    "- Select market order on the right\n",
    "- Trade 10 USD for ETH - Click on sell and set 10 USD\n",
    "- Notice that you can choose the Leverage as well (here, we use the default)\n",
    "- Click *Place Market Order* \n",
    "- Observe the change of Equity and Buying Power on the top-right\n",
    "- Turn to Fills, check the information such as type, side, amount, price\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now perform a limit order. Please follow the steps below:\n",
    "- Select limit order on the right\n",
    "- Observe the Price of USD for both *bids* and *asks*\n",
    "- Set a price between the lowest of asks and the highest of bids as the Limit Price (fill into the Limit Price)\n",
    "- Trade 10 USD for ETH - Click on sell and set 10 USD\n",
    "- Set other parameters as you want (here, we use the default)\n",
    "- Click *Place Limit Order* \n",
    "- Turn to Orders to see the order in process, observe the change of *asks*\n",
    "- After finishing, turn to Fills to check the information\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trade on an AMM\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be contrasting the above trading experience with Uniswap. Uniswap is an AMM; its implementation is lightweight by design; hence, it can be implemented entirely on an L1 blockchain such as Ethereum. As a contract with dYdX V4, trading on Uniswap does not require an account since it interacts directly with the wallet. Let us perform a simple ETH-UNI trade on Uniswap. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Open the Uniswap app and select swap at [https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap)\n",
    "- Connect your metamask wallet on the top right\n",
    "- Select ETH as the token you would supply and UNI as the exchange token\n",
    "- Check funds on metamask\n",
    "- Perform trade with 0.01 SepoliaETH - the order is a market order by default\n",
    "- Click on swap and confirm the transaction on metamask\n",
    "- Select the txid link (on the top-right Pending tab) on Uniswap and observe the trade transaction on Etherscan \n",
    "- The trade should show pending and should be successful in less than 30 sec\n",
    "- Check metamask for withdrawn SepoliaETH \n",
    "- Metamask won't show the UNI token; we need to import it \n",
    "- Get the ERC20 contract address from the transaction on Etherscan (0x1f9840a85d5aF5bf1D1762F925BDADdC4201F984)\n",
    "- Add it with base 0 on metamask, check the status of UNI tokens on metamask \n",
    "- Trade all UNI for SepoliaETH\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that all interactions are visible through your metamask wallet since they occur on the Sepolia blockchain. AMMs like Uniswap also allow anyone to create their trading pair, enabling exchanges for long-tail assets such as UHKD and UETH. We have created a trading pair to exchange UETH-UHKD. To perform trades on this trading pair, follow the steps below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Click on the [swap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap) tab.\n",
    "- Paste the UETH contract address on the from tab (0xd10A9Ec6E827B13cF399fCC7E6424f233E99562a)\n",
    "- Paste the UHKD contract address on the to tab (0x64B6f44862E8800EBd63Cd7f1319C8BF0BC1bb99)\n",
    "- You would need to approve UETH tokens to be used by the Uniswap contract; click on approve and confirm on Metamask.\n",
    "- Once approval is complete, swap 1 UETH by clicking on the swap tab and confirming the transaction on Metamask\n",
    "- Check asset balance changes on Metamask"
