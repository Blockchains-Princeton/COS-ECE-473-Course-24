We will looking at an NFT collection called [Doodles](https://opensea.io/collection/doodles-official); their contract can be found at [https://etherscan.io/address/0x8a90cab2b38dba80c64b7734e58ee1db38b8992e#code](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8a90cab2b38dba80c64b7734e58ee1db38b8992e#code). Please follow the steps below:\n","\n","- Visit this contract, specifically looking at `Doodles.sol` and `ERC721.sol`.\n","- Specifically, note and understand the connection between the `setBaseURI` method in `Doodles.sol` and the `tokenURI` method in `ERC721.sol`, which is what allows the storage of a URI for each token's metadata.\n","- Access the read contract tab, and call the Token URI method on a token id of your choice other than `1`.\n","- Example output for token id `1`: `ipfs://QmPMc4tcBsMqLRuCQtPmPe84bpSjrC3Ky7t3JWuHXYB4aS/1`\n","- This is the IPFS URI where the token's metadata is stored (off-chain). You will submit this URI as part of this lab's submission. To access this link within your browser, you will generate a URL using Cloudflare's IPFS gateway. To do so, replace `ipfs://` with `https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/` for your token URI.\n","  - Example:\n","  https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmPMc4tcBsMqLRuCQtPmPe84bpSjrC3Ky7t3JWuHXYB4aS/1\n","\n","    Output:\n","    ```\n","    {\"image\":\"ipfs:\\/\\/QmTDxnzcvj2p3xBrKcGv1wxoyhAn2yzCQnZZ9LmFjReuH9\",\"name\":\"Doodle #1\",\"description\":\"A community-driven collectibles project featuring art by Burnt Toast. Doodles come in a joyful range of colors, traits and sizes with a collection size of 10,000. Each Doodle allows its owner to vote for experiences and activations paid for by the Doodles Community Treasury. Burnt Toast is the working alias for Scott Martin, a Canadian\\u2013based illustrator, designer, animator and muralist.\",\"attributes\":[{\"trait_type\":\"face\",\"value\":\"holographic beard\"},{\"trait_type\":\"hair\",\"value\":\"white bucket cap\"},{\"trait_type\":\"body\",\"value\":\"purple sweater with satchel\"},{\"trait_type\":\"background\",\"value\":\"grey\"},{\"trait_type\":\"head\",\"value\":\"gradient 2\"}]}\n","    ```\n","- You can repeat this process with the \"image\" value in the metadata to find the image URL for the NFT that is stored off-chain. This process highlights that images/metadata are not always stored on-chain; the NFT is solely the ERC-721 token itself - not the media stored alongside it.\n","\n","# Viewing an \"On-Chain\" NFT Collection\n","\n","Some NFT collections generate their media data on-chain via programmatic execution within the smart contract; we will take a look at the Pixels collection on OpenSea as an example:\n","\n","- Access and interact with a project called The Pixels on OpenSea: https://opensea.io/collection/the-pixels-inc.\n","- Examine the contract at https://etherscan.io/address/0x7ff2a00ff543f913b76010a05b5446e36d403675#code.\n","- Specifically, examine `ThePixelsDNAFactory.sol` where the token images & metadata are programmatically generated on-chain.\n","\n","- Are animations and metadata still stored off-chain on a proprietary API? You can check this using the Token URI method to see where and what metadata is stored.\n","\n","# Minting an NFT\n","\n","We have created a custom NFT contract for this class; it generates SVG images using on-chain logic associated with the token ID to be minted.\n","\n","- Access our ERC-721 NFT contract at: [https://sepolia.etherscan.io/token/0x205160827c1c9e3472e38890b9ab28a75e9fda37](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/token/0x205160827c1c9e3472e38890b9ab28a75e9fda37)\n","- Examine the contract, specifically the `mintNFT` and `generateImage` methods that are not part of the ERC721 standard as well as the overridden `TokenURI` method for the on-chain metadata.\n","- Use the write tab on Etherscan to call the mint method, which will mint an NFT to your address. The cost to mint the NFT is 0.001 SepoliaETH.\n","- Access your NFT's on-chain metadata, and submit the token ID associated with it in this lab's submission.\n","- You can view the token's URI to generate the image. Go to `Read contract` and query your tokenID under the `tokenURI` method. Paste the data on the browser to generate the image.\n","\n","- Note the base64 encoding used for image and metadata generation:\n","    ```\n","    abi.encodePacked(\n","        \"data:image/svg+xml;base64,\",\n","        Base64.encode(svg)\n","      )\n","    ```\n","      \n","\n","# Introduction to IPFS\n","\n","Off-chain storage is critical to the NFT ecosystem. NFTs being unique, prefer IPFS since it is a content-addressable storage platform. We will look at how to interact with IPFS using Pinata.  \n","\n","- Access Pinata IPFS platform by going to [https://app.pinata.cloud/pinmanager](https://app.pinata.cloud/pinmanager) and setting up an account.\n","- Upload an image by clicking on `Add Files`. This will be submitted.\n","- Note the content ID generated by the image - this will be consistent across different gateways, so the image can be accessed across a distributed set of nodes with the same identifier.\n","- Use Cloudflare's gateway to view the stored image: https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/content-id\n","\n","4.
