    "## Liquidation transaction\n",
    "Like \"margin calls\" in traditional finance. Here, the miner spots lending positions that are underwater and liquidates them to earn a commission. Liquidation involves notifying the lending protocol that a the value of \"collateral\" posted by borrower has fallen. This makes the protocol take possession of the collateral and give a commission to the liquidator.\n",

    "# Understanding Sandwich attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we understand Sandwich attacks with two numerical example. For both problems, assume that we have a constant product market maker containing 100 ETH and 100 USD at the start. The miner (Bob) sees a buy transaction (from a user Alice) and decides to sandwich it for earning a profit. Ignore gas and other transaction fees.\n",

    "## Calculating the miner's profit - part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice's transaction is to buy 10 ETH. Bob sandiwiches this in between two of his own transactions, the first one that buys 10 ETH and the second one that sells 10 ETH. What is the profit that Bob earns? (in USD, and rounded to the closest integer)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calculating the miner's profit - part 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an alternative (and more realistic) scenario. Again, Alice's transaction is to buy 10 ETH. But this time, Alice puts a limit on the price she is willing to pay. If the transaction settles for any price greater than the limit, it gets aborted. The price limit is 1.2 USD/ETH. Again, Bob wants to sandwich this in between a buy and a sell transaction of his own, but does not want the Alice's transaction to get aborted (since that will not give him any profit). What is the maximum profit he can achieve in this sandwich attack? (in USD, and rounded to the closest integer)"
